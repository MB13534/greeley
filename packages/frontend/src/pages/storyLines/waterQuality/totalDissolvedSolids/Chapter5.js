        How does Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) get into the South Platte River?
      </h2>
      <p>
        During storm events, pollutants such as fertilizers from lawns, deicers
        on streets, in winter, and other particles from the land can be washed
        into streams and rivers. Because of the large amount of pavement in
        urban areas, natural areas where water can percolate into the ground
        have been removed, and dissolved solids are carried through storm drains
        to creeks and rivers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The effluent from Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) adds dissolved
        solids to a stream. The wastewater from our houses contains both
        suspended and dissolved solids that we put down our drain. Most of the
        suspended solids are removed from the water at the WWTP before being
        discharged to the stream, but WWTPs only remove some of the TDS.
        Important components of the TDS load from WWTPs include phosphorus,
        nitrogen, and organic matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Soil erosion is caused by disturbance of a land surface. Soil erosion
        can be caused by building and road construction, forest fires, logging,
        and mining. The eroded soil particles may contain soluble components
        that can dissolve and be carried by stormwater to surface water. This
        will increase the TDS of the water body.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        As plants and animals decay, dissolved organic particles are released
        and can contribute to the TDS concentration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some rock and soil release ions very easily when water flows over them;
        for example, if acidic water flows over rocks containing calcite
        (CaCO3), such as calcareous shales, calcium (Ca2+) and carbonate (CO32-)
        ions will dissolve into the water. Therefore, TDS will increase.
        However, some rocks, such as quartz-rich granite, are very resistant to
        dissolution, and donâ€™t dissolve easily when water flows over them. TDS
        of waters draining areas where the geology only consists of granite or
        other resistant rocks will be low (unless other factors are involved).
