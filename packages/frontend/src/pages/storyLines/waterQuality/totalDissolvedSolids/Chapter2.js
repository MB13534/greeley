      <h2>What are Total Dissolved Solids (TDS)?</h2>
      <p>
        TDS are solids in water that can pass through a filter. TDS is a measure
        of the amount of material dissolved in water. This material can include
        carbonate, bicarbonate, chloride, sulfate, phosphate, nitrate, calcium,
        magnesium, sodium, organic ions, and other ions. Sometimes, TDS is also
        referred to as “salinity”.
