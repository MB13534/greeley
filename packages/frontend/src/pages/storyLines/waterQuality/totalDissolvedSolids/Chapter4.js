        Why should I care about Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) in the South Platte
        River?
      </h2>
      <p>
        A certain level of these ions in water is necessary for aquatic life.
        However, changes in TDS concentrations can be harmful because the
        density of the water determines the flow of water into and out of an
        organism's cells. The saltier the water, the denser it is. If TDS
        concentrations are too high or too low, the growth of aquatic life can
        be limited, and death may occur.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similar to total suspended solids, high concentrations of TDS may also
        reduce water clarity, contribute to a decrease in photosynthesis,
        combine with toxic compounds and heavy metals, and lead to an increase
        in water temperature.
      </p>
      <p>
        TDS is also used to estimate the quality of drinking water, because it
        represents the amount of ions in the water. Water with high TDS often
        has a bad taste and/or high water hardness, and could result in a
        laxative effect.
