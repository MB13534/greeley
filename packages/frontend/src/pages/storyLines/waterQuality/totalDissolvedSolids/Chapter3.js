      <h2>How are Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) measured?</h2>
      <p>
        To measure TDS, the water sample is filtered, and then the filtrate (the
        water that passes through the filter) is evaporated in a pre-weighed
        dish and dried in an oven at 180Â° C, until the weight of the dish no
        longer changes. The increase in weight of the dish represents the total
        dissolved solids, and is reported in milligrams per liter (mg/l).
