      <h2>Why is water quality important?</h2>
      <p>
        Water is essential to our environmental, social, and economic lives.
        Good water quality protects public health; provides wildlife habitats;
        is used for farming, fishing, and mining; and contributes to recreation
        and tourism. Water quality is closely linked to land use, is affected by
        urban development, and industrial use, agriculture, and recreation.
        Within the urban environment, stormwater runoff can carry bacteria,
        nutrients, trash and other pollutants that impact both natural swimming
        and recreation areas.
