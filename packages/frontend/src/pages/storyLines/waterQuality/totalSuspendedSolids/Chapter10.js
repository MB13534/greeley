        What can I do to help reduce TSS and other pollution in the South Platte
        River?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Use native vegetation or grass to cover and stabilize exposed soil on
        lawns to prevent sediment wash off. Reduce turf areas by planting native
        species to reduce and filter pollutant-laden runoff and prevent the
        spread of invasive, non-native plant species into the storm sewer
        system.
