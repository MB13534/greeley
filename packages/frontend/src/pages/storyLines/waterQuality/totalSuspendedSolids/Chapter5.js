      <h2>Is TSS a regulated pollutant?</h2>
      <p>
        TSS levels in surface water are not regulated in Colorado, meaning there
        are no standards for TSS in rivers, lakes and streams. Permits for waste
        water treatment facilities frequently include TSS standards for
        effluent, or the treated water released from the treatment plant. For
        more information see the{" "}
