      <h2>Why should I care about TSS in the South Platte River?</h2>
      <p>
        The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency identifies sediment as the
        second most widespread cause of impairment of the Nationâ€™s rivers and
        streams. High TSS levels are often accompanied by high concentrations of
        other contaminants like <em>E. coli</em>, giardia, or increased metals
        loads, which are harmful to human health. Elevated TSS levels also
        decrease sunlight penetration in waterways, which can impair growth of
        plants, fish and other aquatic organisms.
