      <h2>How does TSS get into the South Platte River?</h2>
      <p>
        Solids primarily enter waterways through stormwater runoff and erosion.
        Soil, clay, organic matter, chemicals and other solids can be washed off
        the land we use for houses, yards, streets and parking lots, into storm
        sewers and streams after rain or snow melt. Once in the River, some of
        these materials dissolve, some are deposited in stream beds and others
        remain suspended. Total suspended solids can also enter a waterway from
        point sources such as wastewater treatment facilities or mines.
